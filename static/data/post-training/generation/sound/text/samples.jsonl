The last breath should be the most intense, drawn out and strained.", "think": "\n1. User Intent: The user requests a close-miked audio recording of a man breathing heavily, conveying intense physical or emotional struggle—specifically deep, shaky inhales and rough, forced exhales. The recording must be isolated, with no background sounds, and the final breath should be the most intense, drawn out, and strained, evoking tension, panic, or exhaustion.\n\n2. Inferred Details: To fulfill the emotional and physical intensity described, the breathing pattern should include irregular rhythm, vocal strain, and audible tension in the vocal cords. The proximity of the microphone implies intimate, detailed capture of breath textures—such as rasp, wetness, and airflow resistance. The absence of any other sounds suggests a controlled, acoustically treated environment. The progression of breaths should build in intensity, culminating in a prolonged, effortful exhalation that peaks in strain before cutting off abruptly, enhancing the sense of unresolved tension.\n\n3. Audio Quality: The recording should be high-fidelity, studio-quality, with a close-mic technique to capture fine vocal and respiratory details. The acoustic environment must be dry (no reverb or echo), with complete isolation from external noise, indicating professional soundproofing. The breaths should be clearly centered in the stereo field, with no panning or spatial effects, emphasizing intimacy and immediacy. The final breath must be dynamically prominent, with increased amplitude and vocal effort, recorded without distortion despite its intensity.\n\n4. Generation Plan: Synthesize or record a male performer producing a sequence of labored, irregular breaths, starting with deep, shaky inhales and rough, forced exhales. Use a high-sensitivity directional microphone placed very close to the mouth to capture breath nuances. Ensure complete silence in the environment. Structure the performance to escalate in intensity, with the final exhalation being the longest, most strained, and vocally effortful. Edit to remove any ambient noise or artifacts, preserving only the breath sounds and a faint, consistent electronic hiss typical of high-gain studio recordings. Deliver a clean, isolated audio clip that ends abruptly after the final breath.\n", "caption": "The audio clip begins with a single, close-miked male voice, whose breathing is heavy, labored, and raspy, indicating significant physical exertion or distress. The first audible sound is a deep, forceful inhalation, followed by a prolonged, strained exhalation that is both guttural and breathy, suggesting the speaker is struggling to catch his breath. The breathing continues in a pattern of deep, irregular inhales and forceful, uneven exhales, with each breath carrying a sense of urgency and effort. The recording environment is acoustically dry and intimate, with no reverberation, echo, or background noise, and the microphone is positioned extremely close to the speaker’s mouth, capturing every nuance of his breath. The only other sound present is a faint, steady electronic hiss, characteristic of a high-quality recording device in a silent setting. The speaker’s breathing remains the sole focus, with no speech, vocalizations, or other sounds. The final breath is the most intense, with a prolonged, strained exhalation that conveys a sense of exhaustion or emotional distress. The recording ends abruptly, with no fade-out or additional sounds.\n\nIn summary, this audio clip presents a solitary, close-miked recording of a male voice engaged in heavy, distressed breathing, with no speech or environmental context. The technical quality is high, and the absence of background noise or reverberation suggests a controlled, professional setting. The emotional tone is one of physical or emotional struggle, and the clip’s abrupt ending leaves the listener with a sense of unresolved tension."}

User Intent: The user requests an audio recording featuring a powerful male choir performing a slow, wordless, harmonious passage with deep emotion, evoking the acoustics of a cathedral. This is followed by a loud audience reaction—clapping and cheering—two distinct male voices shouting \"Whoa!\" and \"Wow!\", and finally a man speaking into a microphone saying, \"You guys are the best,\" in a warm and sincere tone.\n\n2. Inferred Details: The choir should be large and composed of full male voices (basses, tenors, baritones) to achieve a rich, resonant sound. The performance is wordless and slow, suggesting a solemn, reverent mood with legato phrasing and harmonic depth. The cathedral-like setting implies strong natural reverb and spatial acoustics. The audience reaction must be immediate and enthusiastic, indicating a live performance context. The two shouts (\"Whoa!\" and \"Wow!\") should be distinct in pitch and timing—one higher and more energetic, the other lower and more emphatic—to reflect individual audience members. The final spoken line must be clearly intelligible, delivered via microphone, with a warm, appreciative tone, suggesting a host or performer addressing the choir. The overall sequence should flow naturally from music to applause to speech, with realistic transitions and spatial consistency.\n\n3. Audio Quality: The recording should be high-fidelity, capturing a wide frequency range with clarity and dynamic range. The choir should be recorded with ambient microphones to emphasize the cathedral-like reverb, while maintaining vocal presence and harmonic detail. The applause and cheers should be loud and spatially diffuse, with natural reverberation matching the venue. The two shouts should be slightly off-mic but clearly audible, with natural room reflection. The final spoken line should be close-miked, with slight proximity effect and minimal reverb, indicating a handheld or stand-mounted microphone. A subtle background hiss may be present to reflect realistic recording conditions, but no distortion or clipping should occur. The overall mix should preserve the live, immersive atmosphere.\n\n4. Generation Plan: Begin with a synthesized or sampled large male choir performing a slow, wordless, harmonically rich passage in a reverberant space, using low and mid-range voices to emphasize depth and emotion. Apply cathedral-style reverb to simulate a large acoustic environment. After the final chord decays, layer in a sudden burst of audience applause and cheers with natural crowd dynamics and spatial spread. Insert two distinct male vocal exclamations—\"Whoa!\" (higher pitch, energetic) and \"Wow!\" (lower, emphatic)—shortly after the applause begins, with slight delay and reverb to place them in the same space. Finally, add a close-miked male voice delivering \"You guys are the best\" with warmth and sincerity, using a slightly compressed, clear vocal tone to simulate microphone capture. Ensure smooth transitions between segments and maintain consistent acoustic space throughout to preserve realism.\n", "caption": "The audio clip begins with a powerful, resonant choral performance by a large male choir, singing in a slow, legato style with rich harmonies and a solemn, reverent tone. The choir’s voices are layered, with deep basses and soaring tenors, and the acoustics suggest a vast, reverberant space such as a cathedral or concert hall. The recording is of high fidelity, capturing the full frequency range and the natural decay of the voices, though a faint hiss is present in the background. The choir’s performance is wordless, focusing on sustained vowel sounds and harmonic resonance, and the mood is one of awe and grandeur.\n\nAs the choir’s final chord fades, the audience erupts in enthusiastic applause and cheers, filling the space with a dense, reverberant wash of sound. The applause is immediate and sustained, indicating a large, engaged crowd. Amid the applause, a male voice shouts “Whoa!” in a high-pitched, energetic tone, followed by another male voice exclaiming “Wow!” in a lower, more emphatic register. These spontaneous reactions, along with the ongoing applause, convey a sense of collective admiration and excitement.\n\nShortly after, a male speaker, positioned close to the microphone, addresses the audience in a clear, warm, and appreciative tone. He says, “You guys are the best,” with a friendly and sincere delivery, likely intended as a direct acknowledgment of the choir’s performance. The speech is delivered in General American English, with no regional accent, and is accompanied by the lingering applause and cheers, which continue to reverberate in the space.\n\nThe recording ends abruptly, with the applause and cheers still ongoing, suggesting the clip is an excerpt from a longer event. Throughout, the audio maintains high quality, with no distortion or technical flaws, and the spatial characteristics reinforce the impression of a large, formal venue.\n\nIn summary, the audio captures the climactic moment of a choral performance in a grand, reverberant setting, followed by an enthusiastic audience response and a heartfelt acknowledgment from a speaker.

{"example_id": "mmau_mini_sound_599_realistic", "request": "I need a high-quality recording that starts with the intense, close-up sound of a rushing river—lots of water movement, deep rumbles, and crisp splashes all around. It should feel like you're standing right at the edge. Then, cut to complete silence for a split second before a harsh, loud electronic buzz kicks in—like a warning alarm or malfunctioning machine—and holds steady before cutting out sharply.", "think": "\n1. User Intent: The user requests a high-quality audio recording that begins with an intense, close-up sound of a rushing river—emphasizing deep rumbles, crisp splashes, and immersive water movement—followed by a sudden cut to silence and then a harsh, loud electronic buzz resembling a warning alarm or malfunctioning machine, which holds steadily before cutting out sharply.\n\n2. Inferred Details: To achieve realism and immersion, the river sound must be recorded in stereo with a wide soundstage, capturing both low-frequency rumbles and high-frequency splashes with clarity and spatial depth. The perspective should simulate standing at the river’s edge, requiring close-miking techniques and natural reverb to convey proximity and environmental scale. The transition to silence must be instantaneous, with no fade or residual ambience, to maximize dramatic impact. The electronic buzz should be monophonic, centrally panned, and generated synthetically (e.g., square or sawtooth wave) to sound artificial and jarring, with a frequency around 110 Hz (A2) for a low, penetrating tone. It must be loud, unmodulated, and abruptly terminated to emphasize mechanical harshness and finality.\n\n3. Audio Quality: The recording must be studio-quality, with high dynamic range, no background noise, distortion, or compression artifacts. The river segment should exhibit full-frequency fidelity—deep bass for the rumble, clear mids for water flow, and crisp highs for splashes—captured with professional field recording equipment. The electronic tone should be digitally generated with precision, maintaining consistent amplitude and pitch. The edit between the two segments must be frame-accurate, with zero crossfade or reverb tail, ensuring a stark, cinematic transition.\n\n4. Generation Plan: First, source or record a high-resolution stereo field recording of a powerful river or waterfall, ensuring close proximity to the water and rich textural detail. Process minimally to preserve natural dynamics and spatial imaging. Then, generate a synthetic electronic tone using a waveform generator (e.g., square or sawtooth wave at 110 Hz), normalize it to peak loudness without clipping, and place it centrally in the mix. Edit the sequence to begin with the river sound, cut abruptly to silence for approximately 0.5 seconds, then introduce the electronic tone with zero attack time, sustain it for several seconds, and terminate it with a hard cut. Ensure the final output is rendered in high-bit-depth, high-sample-rate audio format to maintain fidelity.\n", "caption": "The audio begins with a sudden, immersive surge of water, immediately immersing the listener in a powerful, close-up soundscape. The dominant feature is a continuous, low-frequency rumble, evoking the sensation of standing near a large, fast-moving river or waterfall. Layered atop this are mid-frequency gurgles and splashes, as well as high-frequency hissing and fizzing, which together create a rich, textured auditory environment. The stereo field is wide and enveloping, with the sound source positioned directly in front of the listener, suggesting proximity to the water’s edge. The recording is exceptionally clear, with no distortion, static, or background noise, and the dynamic range is preserved, allowing the full spectrum of water sounds to be distinctly heard. The spatial impression is that of a vast, open outdoor setting, with the water’s movement and reverberation hinting at a large, natural space such as a riverbank or canyon. Throughout this segment, there are no human voices, animal sounds, or other environmental cues; the focus remains solely on the water.\n\nAbruptly, the water sound is cut off with no fade or transition, replaced instantly by a loud, synthetic electronic tone. This tone is a low-frequency, buzzy, and harsh sound, reminiscent of a square or sawtooth wave, with a fundamental pitch around 110 Hz (A2). It is monophonic, centered in the stereo field, and completely devoid of any environmental or spatial cues. The tone is static, unmodulated, and maintains a constant volume and pitch, with no vibrato, tremolo, or dynamic changes. Its timbre is abrasive and grating, evoking the sensation of a warning buzzer, error signal, or alarm. The tone is abruptly terminated at the end of the recording, with no fade-out or lingering resonance.\n\nIn summary, the audio clip presents a stark contrast between two distinct sound environments: first, a vivid, high-fidelity recording of a large, natural water feature in an open outdoor setting, and second, a sudden, synthetic electronic tone that is loud, monophonic, and reminiscent of a warning or error signal. The transition between these segments is abrupt and deliberate, with no speech, music, or other environmental sounds present. The overall effect is one of dramatic juxtaposition, likely intended for use in media, sound design, or as a demonstration of contrasting sonic textures."}

Add a continuous background layer of soft hiss and low hum, consistent with analog tape or old digital recorders. Process the voice with EQ to reduce high and low frequencies, simulating a narrow bandwidth. Ensure the final word “quickly” is cut off abruptly mid-syllable, with no fade or tail. Deliver the entire clip in a dry, intimate acoustic environment, preserving the sense of a private, introspective moment captured on modest equipment.\n", "caption": "The audio clip begins with a faint, persistent hiss and a low-frequency hum, indicative of a quiet, acoustically treated room and a recording device with a modest noise floor. A single female speaker, positioned slightly left of center and close to the microphone, starts speaking in a measured, reflective tone. Her voice is clear and articulate, with a General American accent and a mid-to-high pitch, suggesting she is likely a young adult or middle-aged woman. She begins, “…even in this uh crazy society where everybody is in a rush, uh, we are always reading fast and shallow and more more more quickly—” Her delivery is deliberate, marked by pauses and the use of filler words like “uh,” which convey a thoughtful, informal style. The speech is interrupted mid-sentence, with the final word “quickly” cut off abruptly, indicating the recording was stopped suddenly and not allowed to fade naturally.\n\nThroughout the clip, the speaker’s voice remains steady and centered, with no movement or change in spatial position. The room’s acoustics are dry and intimate, with no reverberation or echo, and the only background sounds are the consistent hiss and hum. The recording’s frequency range is limited, with a rolled-off high end and a lack of deep bass, resulting in a somewhat muffled, compressed sound. The dynamic range is narrow, and the overall loudness is moderate, with the voice clearly audible above the background noise. The speaker’s tone is contemplative and slightly critical, expressing concern about the pace and quality of reading in modern society. The use of filler words and the unfinished sentence suggest a spontaneous, informal setting, possibly a personal reflection or a casual conversation.\n\nIn summary, the audio captures a solitary female speaker reflecting on the fast-paced, shallow nature of reading in contemporary society. The recording is characterized by a quiet, intimate environment, a clear but slightly muffled voice, and a sudden, incomplete ending. The speaker’s thoughtful, critical tone and the technical qualities of the recording point to a personal, informal context, with no other voices or environmental sounds present."}
